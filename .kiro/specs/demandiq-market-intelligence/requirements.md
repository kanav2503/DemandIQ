# Requirements: DemandIQ – Autonomous Market Intelligence Copilot for SMEs

## 1. Overview

### Problem Statement
Small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) lack access to advanced data analytics tools and often rely on manual spreadsheets for demand forecasting and pricing decisions. This leads to inventory mismanagement, pricing inefficiencies, and lost revenue.

### Solution
DemandIQ is a multi-agent AI system that analyzes sales and inventory data to provide autonomous, explainable business recommendations including demand forecasting, slow-moving inventory detection, pricing optimization, and revenue impact estimation.

### Target Users
- SME retail store owners
- E-commerce sellers
- Marketplace vendors
- Small supply chain operators
